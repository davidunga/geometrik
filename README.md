geometrik
=========

Tools for analyzing curves under Euclidean, Equi-Affine (aka Special Affine), and Full Affine, geometries.
Contains utilities to compute measures such as arc-length and curvatures under the different geometries, and use them to parameterize curves, define G-invariant similarities between them, etc.
